## About this Project

The goal of this project is simple. It's to promote the sharing of books. Think of it as a decentralized library, where you can both lend and borrow books from other folks in the community. It's like those little tiny libraries that you pass by in people's yards, except this one has many, many more books.

There is no fee to use or join, just simple user agreement that will give you a username (your choice of course) so that it's easier to track books and to make sure books are returned happy and healthy to their original homes.

There is currently no funding for this project, though in the near-ish future I hope to put together some crowd-sourcing proposal to pull together a few bucks to pay someone to put together a proper database.

For now, I will regularly update the master spreadsheet (weekly I hope) and you'll just have to use the "Control 'f'" command to search for the title or author you're looking for.

Please point other people to this site and tell them to contribute.

For now, please direct all questions to readsharedbooks@gmail.com.

For those wishing to add books to the list, please send them in a spreadsheet, either as a google sheet or excel spreadsheet, and I'll enter them into the master list and update the webpage and master excel spreadsheet that is download-able on this site.

I will also make sure to list the last update on the spreadsheet to help avoid confusion.

Cheers!

Scott
