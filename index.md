## Let's Share Books!


The goal of this project is simple. It's to promote the sharing of books. Think of it as a decentralized library, where you can both lend and borrow books from other folks in the community. It's like those little tiny libraries that you pass by in people's yards, except this one has many, many more books.

For now, given my very limited knowledge of websites, the way this works will be as follows:

If you want to be involved check out the list of available books [here](Books\Book list (google sheet version) 12-12-16 v2.pdf) as a PDF. It lists all the books you can borrow from folks who have generously offered up their books for you to borrow, and it lists a way to get in touch with them. From there, it's up to you to get in touch, and figure out how to pick up the book and what sort of return agreement you'll have. Once you do that, send an e-mail to readsharedbooks@gmail.com and I'll update the list to reflect that the book is effectively checked-out and I'll post the expected return date. Once the book is returned happy and healthy I'll delete that record.
Forever.

I won't put the borrowers name on the book list, that information will not be public. If, however problems with delayed returns and/or the quality of returns is a problem, that information will be made public in order to ensure that all books continue to be returned promptly and in good condition.


If you ever want to add more books to the list, send the list as a spreadsheet (both google sheets or excel work best) to <readsharedbooks@gmail.com> and I'll update the list.

I'll do my best to update as often as I can, and each time the list is updated, I'll post the date so you can know if the changes you're expecting are reflected in the latest list.

Until I figure out a better system, or can pay someone to do it properly, the way to find books will simply be to download the PDF and use the Control 'f' command to search the document for whatever it is you want. Perhaps I'll get around to getting things into alphabetical order later.

I'll try to break books up into some categories, but don't expect too much other than:

* Fiction
* Non-fiction
* Reference (textbooks, for example)
* Cooking

Please share this with anyone (in Cache Valley) you think would be interested. I'll keep a running tally of the total books available, and the number of users as well.

For now, please direct all questions and comments to <readsharedbooks@gmail.com>


Cheers!

Scott
